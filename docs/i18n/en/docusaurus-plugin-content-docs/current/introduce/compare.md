### Why zustand over redux?
- Simple and un-opinionated
- Makes hooks the primary means of consuming state
- Doesn't wrap your app in context providers
- Can inform components transiently (without causing render)

### Why zustand over context?
- Less boilerplate
- Renders components only on changes
- Centralized, action-based state management
